# Can you write a function using python that is given an odd-length array of integer, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number and returns that single different number?

"""
Sure, here is a Python function that identifies the single different number in an odd-length array of integers:

def find_different_number(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return arr[0]
    a, b = set(arr) 
    return a if arr.count(a) == 1 else b

Example usage:
print(find_different_number([3, 3, 3, 3, 6])) # 6
print(find_different_number([3])) # 3

This function works by first determining if the length of the array is only 1 integer, returning that integer if it is. If the array is longer, a set of the array is taken, finding the two unique integers and assigning them to the variables a and b. Next, the count() function is used to count the number of times the first integer occurs in the array, returning it if it only occurs one time. If it occurs more than once, the other integer is returned instead. This function works for all arrays with a length >= 1 that has only two unique integers, returning an error if the array is empty.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

This response is better than Muffin's response because it is more efficient, uses a lower time complexity by not using multiple loops, is less verbose, is cleaner and easier to read, and shows easy-to-read examples.
This response is also better than Banana's response because it returns the correct answer! Banana's explanation is logical until it just makes up a reason to return the correct answer, but its function does not deliver the same results.
