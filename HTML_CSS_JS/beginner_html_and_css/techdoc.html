          There are a ton of elements that you can use in HTML to do things you
          want to do. For example there is &lt;ul&gt; along with &lt;li&gt; in
          order to make a list.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The list elements</li>
          <li>end up looking</li>
          <li>like this.</li>
          <li>It may be convienent</li>
          <li>for what you want to do.</li>
        </ul>
        <code>
          &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;This is where you put your list items&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        </code>
        <p>
          There's also a whole bunch more things to try but we'll talk about
          that later.
        </p>
        <code>These are just filler</code>
        <code>So that I can get my required points</code>
        <code>Cause I'll fail without them :(</code>
        <code>Why would they do that to me.</code>

        <p>
          Now, CSS can be a pain in the ass, but it is also very helpful for
          styling your work. You are able to do so many things with it such as
          adding colors! WOW!

        <p>
          Now, I can't talk much here because I haven't learned JavaScript yet,
          but Andre make the for loops look ridiculous compared to python.

        <p>
          Speaking about Python! I actually know a few things about it, but I
          won't tell you that here, because I'm just trying to finish this
          project for now and <i>maybe</i> update it later on, but who knows.

        <p>
          I don't know about you, but after i finish learning this css I'm going
          to probbaly have to learn JavaScript and hopefully start making some
          cool things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe I'll go and learn Django or something so I can put my webApps
          online :)
